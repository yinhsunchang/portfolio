# Front-end Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with Vite, React, and TypeScript, where I share some projects I’ve worked on and the skills I’ve been developing.

I tried to focus on clean layouts, readable typography, and an intuitive user experience. The site also includes bilingual support (English / French) and a responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Drawing on my background in photography and interior design, I aimed to create a site that feels simple, balanced, and visually pleasant.
